# Sproutify
This repository contains just one HTML file, divided into 20 distinct zones. The challenge? Pick an empty zone and build anything you can imagine inside it. It could be a mini-game, a piece of art, a cool animation, or a useful tool. The only limit is your creativity and the boundaries of your zone!
